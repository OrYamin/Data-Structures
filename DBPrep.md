# What to Learn for a Backend Engineer Role (C#, Web API, MSSQL, etc.)

## 1. C# (Server-Side Development)

**What it is**  
- C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. Commonly used for building enterprise-level applications, including web services, desktop apps, and cloud-native solutions.

**What to learn**  
- **Language Fundamentals**: Data types, variables, control flow (`if`, loops), classes, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism.  
- **.NET Core / .NET 6+**: Familiarize yourself with the current .NET runtime (e.g., .NET 6, 7).  
- **Asynchronous Programming**: `async`/`await`, Task Parallel Library.  
- **Dependency Injection**: Widely used in ASP.NET Core for managing service lifetimes.  
- **Best Practices**: Coding conventions, error handling, logging, performance optimization.

## 2. Web API (ASP.NET Core Web API)

**What it is**  
- A way to build RESTful services that expose endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.  
- In .NET, “Web API” often refers to using ASP.NET Core to create HTTP endpoints.

**What to learn**  
- **REST Basics**: HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes, JSON format.  
- **Routing**: Attribute routing (e.g., `[Route("api/[controller]")]`).  
- **Controllers & Actions**: How to structure controllers and return data (`IActionResult`, custom models).  
- **Model Binding & Validation**: Use data annotations like `[Required]`, `[StringLength]`.  
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT, Identity, OAuth if security is required.  
- **Hosting & Deployment**: How to deploy to Azure, AWS, or on-prem servers.

## 3. Visual Studio (Full IDE, not VS Code)

**What it is**  
- A full-featured Integrated Development Environment for .NET. Provides advanced debugging, profiling, and project management tools.

**What to learn**  
- **Solution & Project Structure**: `.sln`, `.csproj` files, how projects fit together.  
- **Debugging Tools**: Breakpoints, step through code, watch windows, immediate window.  
- **NuGet Package Manager**: Adding and managing dependencies.  
- **Integrated Database Tools**: Connecting to SQL databases, running queries, managing schemas.  
- **Build & Publish**: Packaging and deploying .NET apps.

---

## 4. MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server)

**What it is**  
- A popular relational database management system by Microsoft. Often paired with .NET.

**What to learn**  
- **SQL Basics**: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.  
- **Schema Design**: Tables, relationships, normalization (primary, foreign keys).  
- **Stored Procedures, Functions, Triggers**: Writing reusable SQL logic.  
- **Indexing & Query Optimization**: Making queries efficient.  
- **Connecting from .NET**: Using ADO.NET or Entity Framework Core to interact with MSSQL.

## 5. Oracle

**What it is**  
- A major RDBMS used in many enterprise environments, similar to MSSQL but with different syntax and tooling.

**What to learn**  
- **PL/SQL**: Oracle’s procedural extension to SQL.  
- **Oracle Tools**: SQL*Plus, Oracle SQL Developer, ODP.NET.  
- **Syntax Differences**: Data types, functions, and certain SQL queries differ from MSSQL.  
- **Connecting from .NET**: Setting up connection strings, handling transactions, stored procedures.

---

## 6. Blazor

**What it is**  
- A framework for building interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript.  
- Two hosting models: **Server** (C# on the server) and **WebAssembly** (C# in the browser via WebAssembly).

**What to learn**  
- **Razor & Components**: Building reusable UI components with `.razor` files.  
- **Data Binding & Event Handling**: `@code { }` blocks, passing parameters, state management.  
- **Forms & Validation**: Using Blazor’s form components and data annotations.  
- **Client-Server Communication**: If you’re building a Blazor app that consumes ASP.NET Core Web APIs.

---

## Putting It All Together

1. **C# & .NET Fundamentals**  
   - Learn the language features and .NET runtime basics.

2. **ASP.NET Core & Web API**  
   - Practice creating and testing APIs, handling requests/responses, and implementing security.

3. **Databases (MSSQL, Oracle)**  
   - Master SQL queries, stored procedures, and how to connect from C#.

4. **Visual Studio**  
   - Get comfortable with the IDE, debugging, project templates, and NuGet.

5. **Blazor**  
   - Acquire at least a basic understanding of building front-end UIs in C#.

### Practical Tips

- **Build Small Projects**: A simple Web API + MSSQL + Blazor front-end is a great start.  
- **Microsoft Docs & Tutorials**: Official docs are very thorough.  
- **Entity Framework Core**: A popular ORM that simplifies data access.  
- **Source Control**: Get comfortable with Git (GitHub, Azure DevOps) for version control.  
- **Stay Current**: Keep up with new features (like Minimal APIs in .NET 6+) and best practices.
